This project is a simulation of the classical "Dining Philosophers Problem". It explores multithreading and synchronization issues using mutexes to prevent deadlocks and race conditions.

Key concepts:
- Multithreading in C (pthreads)
- Mutexes for synchronization
- Deadlock prevention
- Concurrent programming
